# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/pages/`: Route files (e.g., `index.astro`). Each file maps to a URL.
- `src/components/`: Reusable UI in PascalCase (e.g., `Welcome.astro`).
- `src/layouts/`: Page wrappers (e.g., `Layout.astro`).
- `src/assets/`: Local images/svgs used by components and pages.
- `public/`: Static assets served at root without bundling.
- `astro.config.mjs` / `tsconfig.json`: Project and TypeScript config.
- Build output: `dist/` (generated by `npm run build`).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm run dev`: Start local dev server with hot reload.
- `npm run build`: Produce optimized static site into `dist/`.
- `npm run preview`: Serve the built site from `dist/` for verification.
- `npm run astro`: Run Astro CLI (scaffolding, diagnostics, etc.).

Example: after changes, verify locally
```
npm run build && npm run preview
```

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Indentation: 2 spaces; keep lines focused and readable.
- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `HeroBanner.astro`).
- Utilities/vars: camelCase; routes/files in `pages/` use kebab-case where applicable.
- Assets: place in `src/assets/`; reference via relative imports.
- Styling: Co-locate `<style>` blocks in components/layouts unless shared.
- Formatting: Use a formatter (Prettier recommended). Keep diffs minimal.

## Testing Guidelines
- Currently no test runner is configured. For contributions adding tests, prefer:
  - Unit/component: Vitest + @astrojs/renderer (or Playwright for E2E).
  - Naming: mirror source path, e.g., `src/components/Hero/Hero.test.ts`.
- Run tests via `npm test` once introduced; keep coverage meaningful for critical UI.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commits: Small, focused changes. Conventional style encouraged:
  - `feat: add hero section`
  - `fix: correct layout spacing on mobile`
- PRs: Include
  - Summary of changes and rationale
  - Linked issue (if any)
  - Screenshots/GIFs for UI changes
  - Steps to verify locally (`npm run dev` or `preview` link)
- Ensure `npm run build` succeeds and there are no console errors.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Do not commit secrets or API keys. This is a static site—keep secrets server-side.
- Use `public/` only for files safe to serve directly.
- Validate user-provided content before rendering, if introduced.
